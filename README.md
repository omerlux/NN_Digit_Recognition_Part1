# Neural-Network---Part-1---Digit-Recognition
Machine Learning Digit Recognition

I made a network to recognize handwriten digits.
Network - The network is the neural network which can be calculated by 2 cost function, quadratic and cross-entropy.
The network can build up with as many of layers you whish, when the input is 784 neurons and the output is 10.

SGD optimizer - The optimizer can be (for now) 3 different optimizers, that are established on the back propagation algorithem for gradient decent. 
The optimizers are:
1. Stochastic Gradient decent.
2. Momentum.
3. RMSProp.

Results are in "Few Tests.pdf".
